# modern-d-swig
Modernize D code generated by SWIG

Currently, this tool only converts imports of `std.c` to `core.stdc`. For an example, create a D source file called `test.d` with the following statement somewhere in the file:
```d
import std.c;
```

Then run this program on it:

```bash
# Using dub
dub run -- test.d
# Not using dub
modern-d-swig test.d
```

and watch the file contents change.

PRs welcome.
